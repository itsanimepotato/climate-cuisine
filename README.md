This is a (buggy) game based off of a Papa's Pizzeria game! Use the buttons 1,2,3,4 and 5 to move between screens!  
To play: 
- see what you need to make on the order screen (screen 1)
- drag your mouse over the carbon dioxide on the capture screen (screen 2)
- press the converting chamber to convert your CO2 into the base materials (carbon based/calcium based) needed (screen 3)
- convert the base material into the material you need (screen 4)
- buy stuff to make it easier to collect carbon dioxide (screen 5)
